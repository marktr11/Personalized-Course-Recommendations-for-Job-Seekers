# Clustering Configuration
use_clustering: true                                  # Whether to use clustering for reward adjustment
auto_clusters: true                                   # Whether to automatically determine optimal number of clusters
max_clusters: 10                                      # Maximum number of clusters to try when using elbow method
n_clusters: 4                                         # Number of clusters for K-means clustering (used if auto_clusters=false)

# Purpose
# This configuration is designed to compare:
# 1. Models with clustering-based reward adjustment (Usefulness-as-Rwd, Weighted-Usefulness-as-Rwd,Baseline)
# 2. Models without clustering (Usefulness-as-Rwd, Weighted-Usefulness-as-Rwd,Baseline)
# The comparison helps evaluate the impact of clustering on learning stability and performance

# Model Hyperparameters for feature "Weighted-Usefulness-as-Rwd"
